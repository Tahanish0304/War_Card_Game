# War_Card_Game
Simple Application of OOPs in Python

We will use Python OOP to simulate a simplified version of the game war. Two players will each start off with half the deck, then they each remove a card, compare which card has the highest value, and the player with the higher card wins both cards.
At time of war it takes 5 cards from each player(which can be chaged).
Here We use OOPs application to complete the project.
